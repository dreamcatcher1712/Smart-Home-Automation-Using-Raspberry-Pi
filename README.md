# Smart-Home-Automation-Using-Raspberry-Pi

This project is a part of the course Software Engineering and Project Management, which focuses on the implementation of smart home automation using Raspberry Pi, a low-cost, single-board computer. The project begins with the identification of the software project and creating a business case for it. A problem statement is formulated based on the identified process methodology and stakeholder description. The project's system, functional, and non-functional requirements are defined in detail. A project plan is prepared based on the scope, and project effort is calculated based on resources and job roles and responsibilities. A work breakdown structure and timeline chart are also prepared, and risks are identified and documented in a risk identification table. The system architecture is designed, and use case and class diagrams are created. An entity relationship diagram is designed to capture the relationships between entities in the system. A data flow diagram up to level 1 is developed to show how data flows within the system. Sequence and collaboration diagrams are also created to show the interaction between system components. A testing framework and user interface are developed, and test cases are written and executed to ensure the system meets the requirements. Manual test case reporting is done to document the results of the testing. Finally, the details of the architecture design, framework, and implementation are provided, including the technologies used, programming languages, and libraries. Overall, the project successfully implements smart home automation using Raspberry Pi, demonstrating the potential for low-cost, effective home automation solutions.
